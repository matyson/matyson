# Professional Journey

As a mathematician turned software developer, I've found a unique intersection between abstract mathematical thinking and practical problem-solving. Mathematics provides me with a powerful lens through which I analyze and solve challenges, ranging from everyday scenarios to complex technical problems. My growing passion for web development has allowed me to apply this analytical mindset in creating innovative solutions for the digital space.

## CNPEM

_Senior Technology Development Analyst, 2019 - present_

My journey at CNPEM began as a mathematician eager to apply algorithmic and optimization techniques to real-world challenges. What started as a focused pursuit in scientific computing evolved into a comprehensive career in software development, marking a transformative professional journey.

### Career Progression

- I joined the Scientific Computing group at [LNLS](https://lnls.cnpem.br/sirius/) in 2019 as an intern, primarily focusing on image processing and reconstruction algorithms. This period marked significant growth in my technical skills, as I developed expertise in Python, CUDA, and algorithm optimization despite my initial limited programming experience.

- Upon graduating in 2020, I transitioned to a full-time role within the Scientific Computing group. While continuing my work on image processing and reconstruction algorithms, I began championing web development initiatives, leading efforts to modernize our technology stack. I played a key role in implementing software development best practices, including robust CI/CD pipelines, systematic code reviews, and comprehensive documentation standards.

- In 2023, my growing expertise in web development and software engineering led to my transfer to the Control Software group. Here, I work on cutting-edge web applications that control accelerators and processing interfaces. My current mission is to establish modern web technologies as the standard within LNLS, aiming to set new benchmarks for the accelerator community.

## Early Career Experience

_Teaching, 2018 - 2019_

During my early college years, I discovered a profound connection with teaching while questioning my academic path. I dedicated myself to teaching mathematics and physics at college entrance exam preparatory courses. This experience not only enhanced my communication skills but also deepened my understanding of fundamental concepts. While my career has taken me in a different direction, I maintain the aspiration to return to education someday, enriched by my professional experiences and technical expertise.
